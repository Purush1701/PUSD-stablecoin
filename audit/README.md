# Audit Reports Directory

This directory stores security audit reports generated by automated analysis tools.

## Contents

- **Slither Reports**: Static analysis reports generated by the Slither security scanner
  - Reports are automatically generated by GitHub Actions CI/CD on every push/PR
  - Reports are saved with timestamps: `slither-checklist-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md` and `slither-report-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json`
  - Reports are also uploaded as GitHub Actions artifacts (90-day retention)

## Local Generation

To generate reports locally:

```bash
npm run security:slither
```

This will create:

- `slither-checklist.md` - Human-readable checklist report
- `slither-report.json` - Machine-readable JSON report

**Note**: These files are in `.gitignore` and won't be committed to the repository. Only CI/CD-generated reports with timestamps are archived here.

## CI/CD Integration

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/slither-analysis.yml`) automatically:

1. Runs Slither analysis on every push/PR to `main`
2. Saves timestamped reports to this directory
3. Uploads reports as downloadable artifacts
4. Fails the build if High or Medium severity findings are detected

## Compliance

All security reports are retained for compliance tracking and can be downloaded from GitHub Actions artifacts or found in this directory after CI/CD runs.
